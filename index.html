        [Aug 2024] Kicked off my journey as a professor at FSU. Go Noles!<br>
        <div class="hidden-content">
        [Mar 2024] I'm thrilled to announce my latest adventure. This August, I'll be joining the Computer Science Department at Florida State University as an Assistant Professor.<br>
        [Aug 2023] As a co-chair, I organized the first SPARKS event for AI-EDGE, connecting 70+ Ph.D. students and postdocs across 8 universities. Amazed by their brilliance!<br>
        [Aug 2023] Our work 'LightThief' got accepted by USENIX Security'23. Who knew my optical engineering skills from 7 years ago would come back into play? <br>
        [Jul 2023] My two undergraduate students successfully presented their research in the REU program. Over the past two months, they've been diligently learning about wireless networking, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. Wishing them a bright future ahead!<br>
        [Jan 2023] I organized the AMC 8 Math Competition for students at Ohio State. It was heartwarming to see young students' enthusiasm for STEM. Who knows, some of them may be my future Ph.D. students!<br>
        [Aug 2022] I've joined the AI-EDGE Institute at OSU for my postdoctoral work. Looks like I'll be mingling with AI from now on—let's hope it likes me as much as I'm fascinated by it! <br>
        [Nov 2021] Our work 'ICSL' got accepted by ACM CCS'21. Buckle up, folks! We're taking a detour into the wild world of cybersecurity—wish us luck! <br>
        [Apr 2021] Our work 'TScatter' finally found its home in USENIX NSDI'21. After so many revisions, the one thing I forgot to revise was the name. Now everyone keeps asking me why it's called 'TScatter'. 'T' stands for 'Transfer,' as in FFT. Yes, we're transferring information through time and frequency domains!—all without a battery!<br>
        [Jun 2020] I brought the oscilloscope home and set up an experimental station in the basement. Now I have a perfect 'scientific' excuse to dodge some quality time with my wife!<br>
        [Aug 2020] Our work 'LScatter' got accepted in ACM SIGCOMM'20. Thanks to the pandemic, the grand international conference venue has been downgraded to my still-messy living room. <br>
        [Feb 2020] Our work 'VMscatter' got accepted by USENIX NSDI'20. Guess I'll be California Dreamin' on my way to the conference—hopefully, the journey will be warmer than this winter's day! <br>
        [Nov 2019]  Our work 'PIC' was awarded <font color=#297AB5>Best Paper Award Candidate</font> at ACM SenSys'19. It's like our CTC 'farewell tour', but don't worry—I'll be back! <br>
        [Nov 2018]  Our work 'Passive-ZigBee' snagged <font color=#297AB5>Best Paper Runner-Up Award</font> at ACM SenSys'18. Believe it or not, we're the first team to try and marry CTC with backscatter technologies. It's like a techy blind date—awkward but promising!

    <p>Before joining FSU, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at the <a href="https://aiedge.osu.edu/">AI-EDGE Institute</a> at <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University (OSU)</a>, where I had the privilege of working under the joint guidance of Prof. Ness Shroff, Prof. Eylem Ekici, and Prof. Kannan Srinivasan. I completed my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.umbc.edu/">University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)</a>, where I was mentored by Prof. Ting Zhu (now at OSU).</p>
